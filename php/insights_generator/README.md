# About
This is part of a sample command line script for Artisan/Laravel that generates an Excel file with data insights fetch from a MySQL database.

It showcases ORM, raw queries, caching, and a separation of concerns as below:
`CLI Controller => Data Generators => Data Fetchers`

Sensitive parts have been anonymised, and removed classes are left as examples of full functionality.

# Improvements
- Throttle/Chunk queries
- Move relevant data into Search DB, such as ElasticSearch.
